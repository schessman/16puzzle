15 Puzzle in Rust with WebAssembly and wgpu

This project implements a classic 15 Puzzle (also known as the sliding puzzle) using Rust, WebAssembly (WASM), and the wgpu graphics API. The puzzle is rendered in a web browser, allowing users to interact with the tiles by clicking on them to slide them into the empty space.
# Features

    Interactive 15 Puzzle: Click on a tile adjacent to the empty space to slide it into the gap.
    Move Counter: Displays the number of moves made so far.
    Restart Button: Resets the puzzle to a new, solvable configuration.
    Solvable Puzzles: Ensures all generated puzzles are mathematically solvable using a proper scrambling method.
    Web-based: Runs in any modern web browser via WASM.

# Requirements

To develop and run this project, you need the following:
1. Rust Toolchain

Install Rust via rustup:
bash

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

Ensure you have:

    rustc (Rust compiler)
    cargo (Rust package manager)

2. WebAssembly Target

Add the WASM target to your Rust toolchain:
bash

rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

3. wasm-bindgen

Used to bridge Rust and JavaScript for WASM:
bash

cargo add wasm-bindgen

4. wasm-bindgen-futures

For async/await support in WASM:
bash

cargo add wasm-bindgen-futures

5. wgpu

The modern GPU abstraction library for rendering:
bash

cargo add wgpu

6. wasm-pack

Tool to build and package Rust projects for the web:
bash

cargo install wasm-pack

7. Python 3 and     python -m http.server

For serving the web app and managing frontend dependencies:

    Install python3

# Project Setup

    Create a new Rust project:
    bash

cargo new --lib 15-puzzle-wasm
cd 15-puzzle-wasm

Add the required dependencies to Cargo.toml:
toml

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"
wasm-bindgen-futures = "0.4"
wgpu = "0.16"
rand = "0.8"

Build the project for WASM:
bash

wasm-pack build --target web

Set up the frontend:
Create an index.html file in the project root:

Serve the app using a simple HTTP server:
bash

    python -m http.server
    Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

# Puzzle Logic (Solvable Generation)

To ensure every generated puzzle is solvable, the algorithm works as follows:

    Start from the solved state:
    text

    1  2  3  4
    5  6  7  8
    9 10 11 12

13 14 15 _
text


2. Randomly select a valid move (slide a tile into the empty space).

3. Repeat for **between 50 and 500 random steps**.

4. The resulting configuration is guaranteed to be solvable because:
- All valid moves preserve the **parity invariant** of the puzzle.
- Since we start from a solvable state and only apply legal moves, the result remains solvable.

> This method avoids the complexity of checking solvability via inversion count.

##  Rendering with wgpu

- The puzzle grid is rendered using `wgpu` for high-performance, hardware-accelerated graphics.
- Each tile is drawn as a colored rectangle with text.
- Click events are captured via JavaScript and forwarded to Rust using `wasm-bindgen`.

---

##  Build & Run

```bash
# Build for WASM
wasm-pack build --target web

# Serve the app
# TODO: figure out the python command line to serve this

Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
# Notes

    Performance: wgpu is used for efficient rendering; avoid unnecessary re-renders.
    Error Handling: Use console.error() and wasm-bindgen's #[wasm_bindgen] macros to handle JS-Rust communication safely.
    Extensibility: Add features like timer, difficulty levels, or animation effects in the future.
